    "Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and it's easy to understand why: it involves a lot of scoring and its fast-paced tempo, paired with a rather straightforward set of rules, makes it accessible to a casual audience and exciting to watch. \n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about basketball, most people think about the NBA, the top league in the USA, which can count on some of the best players in the world. However, it is important to acknowledge that basketball is played professionally all around the world. Especially in Europe, this sport has deep solid roots and can count on a [long tradition](https://www.sports-fitness.co.uk/blog/growth-basketball-europe). In fact, many believe the level of competition there is comparable to the one of the NBA and, in [exhibition games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_versus_EuroLeague_games#2010s) held during the off season, it's not unusual to see a European team beat an NBA squad.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important European basketball league is (very intuitively) called Euroleague. Unlike the NBA, where all franchises (except one) are American, teams from many different European countries participate in the Euroleague. Moreover, compared to the same 30 teams that are part of the NBA, only 16 to 18 different clubs compete in the Euroleague within a semi-open system; this means that, next to a slate of teams which return every year thanks to a special license, there are a few open slots assigned on merit according to the standings of each country's national league. Besides their format, the NBA and Euroleague also differ in some of their rules, from the size of the court to the actual in-game calls. The reader can refer to [this page](https://www.fiba.basketball/rule-differences) for an overview of these rule differences.   "

We will scrape this data from the internet with the help of the `requests` library and the `Beautiful Soup` parser. The data will come from two main sources: [BasketballReference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) for the NBA and [RealGM.com](https://basketball.realgm.com/international/league/1/Euroleague/home) for the Euroleague. For either league, we are interested in both teams' and players' data. The latter will include both statistical and biographical data."
