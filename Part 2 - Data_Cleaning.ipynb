    "Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and it's easy to understand why: it involves a lot of scoring and its fast-paced tempo, paired with a rather straightforward set of rules, makes it accessible to a casual audience and exciting to watch. \n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about basketball, most people think about the NBA, the top league in the USA, which can count on some of the best players in the world. However, it is important to acknowledge that basketball is played professionally all around the world. Especially in Europe, this sport has deep solid roots and can count on a [long tradition](https://www.sports-fitness.co.uk/blog/growth-basketball-europe). In fact, many believe the level of competition there is comparable to the one of the NBA and, in [exhibition games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_versus_EuroLeague_games#2010s) held during the off season, it's not unusual to see a European team beat an NBA squad.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important European basketball league is (very intuitively) called Euroleague. Unlike the NBA, where all franchises (except one) are American, teams from many different European countries participate in the Euroleague. Moreover, compared to the same 30 teams that are part of the NBA, only 16 to 18 different clubs compete in the Euroleague within a semi-open system; this means that, next to a slate of teams which return every year thanks to a special license, there are a few open slots assigned on merit according to the standings of each country's national league. Besides their format, the NBA and Euroleague also differ in some of their rules, from the size of the court to the actual in-game calls. The reader can refer to [this page](https://www.fiba.basketball/rule-differences) for an overview of these rule differences.   "

    "In this notebook we clean the data we scraped in the first part of the project. The goal is to aggregate and uniformize the NBA and EL tables; in doing this, we will have to take into account the different playing time of games in the NBA and in the EL (this is one of the rules inconsistencies we mentioned above). At the end, we will have two DataFrames: one consisting of the players' data for both leagues and the other consisting of the teams' data for both leagues. "

    "Among the remaining columns, a few of them are rather self-explanatory. In particular, the first column contains the players' names and the last two specify to what league and year each row belongs to. Perhaps, for those with little sports knowledge, it is harder to grasp the abbreviations used for the players' stats. Moreover, some of these stats only appear in the NBA DataFrame (which has seven extra columns) or they appear in both DataFrames but under different names. Therefore, for sake of clarity, let's explicitly go over the meaning of each column. We will list them as they are in the NBA table and then we will specify if they can also be found in the EL table (and under what name).   \n",

Before combining the two DataFrames, however, we need to take into account one last crucial detail: in the NBA games last 48 minutes while in the EL only 40.
